 ## Libraries Used
 
 * Numpy
 * Pandas
 * Matplotlib
 * Seaborn
 * Scikit Learn
 * Warnings
 
 ## Conclusion
* The model obtained from the defined dataframe provided is only 58% accurate
* Scaling the data provided better results(accuracy, precision score, f1 score etc..)
* The model obtained from the scaled dataframe is 96% accurate
* Iterating the model using different values of C & gamma through GridSearchCV provides a better fit
* The Final model obtained is 97% accurate and a best fit
